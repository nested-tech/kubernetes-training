Some of the basics to get you started.

### Pods

### Node
A physical or virtual machine running Kubernetes, onto which pods can be scheduled.

### Service
A service defines a set of pods and a means by which to access them, such as single stable IP address and corresponding DNS name.

### Minikube
A tool that makes it easy to run Kubernetes locally. It runs a single-node Kubernetes cluster inside a VM on your laptop. Supports the majority of Kubernetes features. For more help see the guide [here](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/minikube/)
