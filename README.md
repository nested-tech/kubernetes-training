# kubernetes-training
A small subset of the infrastructures code for learning how to manage containers.

### Docker (getting started) 

Inside the `application` folder run the below steps:
1. `npm run image:build`
2. `npm run image:run`
3. In a browser open http://localhost:3000
4. `docker ps`
5. `docker stop <our container id>`

We will now build and interact with our cluster using the `kubectl` CLI client.
